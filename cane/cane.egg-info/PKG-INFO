Description: # Categorical Arrangement of Nominal variables Environment (CANE) 
        CANE is a simpler but powerful preprocessing method for machine learning. 
        
        
        At the moment offers 2 preprocessing methods:
        
        The Percentage Categorical Pruned (PCP) merges all least frequent levels (summing up to perc percent) into a single level as presented in (https://doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2019.8851888).
        
        The Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) codifies the levels into frequency values, where the closer to 0 means, the more frequent it is (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8710472).

        # example
        ``` python
        import pandas as pd
        import cane
        x=["a","a","a","b","b","b","b","b","c","c","c","c","c","c","c","d"]
        df=pd.DataFrame({"x":x,"x2":x})
        dataPCP, dicionary = cane.PCP_Data(df.copy()) #always send a copy of the dataframe
        dataIDF = cane.IDF_Data(df.copy()) #always send a copy of the dataframe
        ```
